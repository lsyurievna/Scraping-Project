# Scraping-Project

I am currently looking for a Master's program in Chemistry. I am particularly interested in computation/instrumentation-heavy areas. Sometimes university websites group their faculty by area of research. This is not the case for McGill, where there is a list with names and I therefore have to go through everyone's profiles to see weather their research corresponds with my interests.

This program gives me a way to see which professors I might be interested to work with at a glance. It goes through every faculty's research page and extracts information about their research. The program then summarizes the text presented on their page and puts all the information in a .csv file.

The final product is a short and simple Excel file that I can scroll through and immediately identify which faculty members I might be interested to work for based on their research tldr.
